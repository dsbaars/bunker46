# Bunker46 – Cursor rules

## Security

- **CORS:** Do not use `*` for CORS when the API uses credentials. Keep `CORS_ORIGINS` to explicit origins (e.g. frontend origin only). Document in README or env example if adding new origins.
- **CSRF:** For critical state-changing actions, consider SameSite cookie attributes and/or CSRF tokens if expanding beyond the current same-origin + strict CORS setup.
- **Auth:** JWT secret must come from validated env only (no fallback in production code). New auth-related endpoints should have rate limiting.
- **Access control:** Routes that take a resource ID (e.g. `:id`, `:keyId`) must resolve the resource and verify ownership (e.g. `userId` or role) before returning or modifying.
- **User-controlled URLs:** Any server-side fetch or WebSocket to user-provided URLs must validate scheme and host (allowlist or blocklist of private IPs).
- **Input validation:** Use shared Zod schemas or class-validator DTOs for request bodies; avoid `body: any` for user input.
- **Tokens:** Prefer Authorization header over query parameters for bearer tokens.
